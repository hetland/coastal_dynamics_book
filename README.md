# coastal_dynamics_book
A free text book on classic models of coastal ocean dynamics.

I wrote the majority of this book while on sabbatical at Ocean University in Qingdao, China. This was the basis of a course that I tought there, and then later continued to occasionally teach at Texas A&M. These are the files used to create the book. Note that there are a few sections near the end of the book that are incomplete, and have been so for a decade. I may get around to them, but since I am not teaching anymore, it is more likely I won't. Hopefully you will find the parts that are there useful.

You can download a PDF of the book [here](https://github.com/hetland/coastal_dynamics_book/raw/main/coastal_dynamics_book.pdf).
